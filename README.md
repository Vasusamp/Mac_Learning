project title : Machine Learning - Predicting Phishing

Objective : The objective of this project is the efficient prediction of phishing websites using supervised machine learning algorithms.

Need of the Study : Phishing is one of the luring techniques used by phishing artist in the intention of exploiting the personal details of unsuspected users. Phishing website is a mock website that looks similar in appearance but different in destination. The unsuspected users post their data thinking that these websites come from trusted financial institutions. Several antiphishing techniques emerge continuously but phishers come with new technique by breaking all the antiphishing mechanisms. Hence there is a need for efficient mechanism for the prediction of phishing website. This project employs Machine-learning technique for modelling the prediction task and supervised learning algorithms namely Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision tree, Na√Øve bayes, KNN and SGD. classification are used for exploring the results. It has been observed that the decision tree classifier predicts the phishing website more accurately when comparing to other learning algorithms.
